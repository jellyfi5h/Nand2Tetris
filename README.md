#Nand2Tetris
Nand2Tetris is a project where to build a complete 16-bit general-purpose computer from scratch starting only from a given Nand Gate chip to build more complex chips as additives, ALUs and registers to build CPU components and memory. in this project will use hdl (hardware description language) in order to simulate and implement these chips / components
